Running the script
Download the script folder
Prod.zip
Unzip where you want
Memu must be placed on the top left corner of your main monitor

Keep MEMU unobstructed. The folder containing the run.exe file should be off to the side unable to come above the emulator.
To run the script, have MCOC open on an arena, then run the “run.exe” application
A window will open up below MEMU giving you some information on what the script is currently doing e.g. Champ setup, and what how many series the script has completed in its current run.

QUIT NOW will end the script at the current moment.
QUIT AFTER SERIES will end the script after the current set of fights have been completed
The script takes control of keyboard and mouse controls, so you can’t use the computer for much else because MEMU needs to always be in focus
